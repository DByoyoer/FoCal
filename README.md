# FoCal: Calendar + Task App

### A productivity web application that integrates a calendar with task scheduling capabilities with a pomodoro timer that automatically generates a focus/break schedule based on user preferences and the standard pomodoro defaults designed to boost productivity and keep users on track in their projects and goals.

#### This project is currently in the initial development phase. To run the project just run `vite`  in the `./client` director, the site should then be available on your local machine at `http://localhost:5173/`. You can drag and drop the calendar events, as well as resize them, however they have no permanent state and you cannot create a new event yet. Both features are coming soon!
