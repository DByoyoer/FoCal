# FoCal: Calendar + Task App v1.3

### A productivity web application that integrates a calendar with task scheduling capabilities with a pomodoro timer that automatically generates a focus/break schedule based on user preferences and the standard pomodoro defaults designed to boost productivity and keep users on track in their projects and goals. Currently we are in the process of rolling out a login feature so that individuals can save all their events and a projets feature so that they can organize them according to a common goal!
